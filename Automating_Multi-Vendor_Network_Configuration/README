# Network Device Configuration Automation with Ansible Roles and Collections

This project demonstrates how to use Ansible roles and content collections to automate the configuration of SNMP, NETCONF, and syslog across multiple network devices from different vendors, including Juniper, Cisco, and Arista. Additionally, it includes tasks for exploring supported network resource modules using the `network.base` collection.

## Overview

This project automates network configuration tasks, including:
- Enabling NETCONF on Juniper devices.
- Configuring SNMP settings on Juniper, Cisco, and Arista devices.
- Configuring syslog on Cisco devices.
- Listing supported network resource modules for Cisco IOS devices.

The project leverages Ansible roles and collections to streamline playbook design and enhance modularity.
